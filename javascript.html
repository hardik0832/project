          <img  id ="im" src="images/JavaScript-Logo.png"

          <pre> Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.
            JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
            JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.
           
           <pre> 

<h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
<pre>
    <p>There are following features of JavaScript:<br>
        1.All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.<br>
        2. JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.<br>
        3.  JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).<br>
        4.   JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.<br>
        5.  It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.<br>
        6.  It is a case-sensitive language.<br>
        7. JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.<br>
        8.  It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>History of JavaScript</h3>  
<p>In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994,
   Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic.
   Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers
   and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich
   intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, 
   the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its
   Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were
   there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's.
   It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team
   replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally
    renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.</p>

    <h1>Application of JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:<br>
        1.Client-side validation,
        2.Dynamic drop-down menus,
        3.Displaying date and time,
        4.Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
        5.Displaying clocks etc.

<h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
<p>
    JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted,
     full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for 
     adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users
    can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of 
      interactivity and simplicity.

    Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity 
     in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side developments. 
    It is also known as a scripting language for web pages. This free JavaScript Tutorial is designed to help both beginners and experienced professionals master the 
    fundamentals of JavaScript and unleash their creativity to build powerful web applications. From basic syntax and data types to advanced topics such as object-oriented
    programming and DOM manipulation.

<h1>JavaScript Variable</h1>
<p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables 
    in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.<br>
    There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).</p><br>
    1.Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
    2.After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
    3.JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables
    <h5>Correct JavaScript variables</h5>
    <div id="box2">
        <p>
            var x = 20;
            var value="name";

<h1>
    JavaScript Comment
</h1>
<p>
    he JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information about the code,
     warnings or suggestions so that end user can easily interpret the code.
    The JavaScript comment is ignored by the JavaScript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.

Advantages of JavaScript comments:
          1.To make code easy to understand It can be used to elaborate the code so that end 
          user can easily understand the code.<br>
          2.To avoid the unnecessary code It can also be used to avoid the code being executed. 
          Sometimes, we add the code to perform some action. But after sometime, there may be need 
          to disable the code. In such case, it is better to use comments.
 <h1>Types of JavaScript Comments
</h1>
There are two types of comments in JavaScript.

        1.Single-line Comment
        2.Multi-line Comment
        <h2>JavaScript Single line Comment</h2>
        it is represented by double forward slashes (//). It can be used before and after the statement.
        Let’s see the example of single-line comment i.e. added before the statement.

<div  id="box4">
    <xmp>
        <script>  
            // It is single line comment  
            document.write("hello javascript");  
            </script>
    </xmp>
</div>
Let’s see the example of single-line comment i.e. added after the statement.
<div id="box5">
    <xmp>
        <script>  
            var a=10;  
            var b=20;  
            var c=a+b;//It adds values of a and b variable  
            document.write(c);//prints sum of 10 and 20  
            </script>  

    </xmp>
</div>
<h2>JavaScript Multi line Comment
</h2>
It can be used to add single as well as multi line comments. So, it is more convenient.
It is represented by forward slash with asterisk then asterisk with forward slash. For example:
<div id="sm">
<xmp>
    /* your code here  */  
</xmp>
</div>
It can be used before, after and middle of the statement.
<div id="box6">
    <xmp>
        <script>  
            /* It is multi line comment.  
            It will not be displayed */  
            document.write("example of javascript multiline comment");  
            </script>
    </xmp>
</div>
</p>
</section>
<section id="global">
   <h1>JavaScript Global Variable</h1> 
   <p>
    A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function or declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.<br>
    Let’s see the simple example of global variable in JavaScript.
<div id="boxgoble1">
    <xmp>
        <script>  
            var value=50;//global variable  
            function a(){  
            alert(value);  
            }  
            function b(){  
            alert(value);  
            }  
            </script>
    </xmp>
</div>
<h2>Declaring JavaScript global variable within function</h2>
    To declare JavaScript global variables inside function, you need to use window object. For example:
<div id="boxgoble2">
    window.value=90;  

</div>
Now it can be declared inside any function and can be accessed from any function. For example:

<div id ="boxgoble3">
    <xmp>
        <script>
            function m(){  
            window.value=100;//declaring global variable by window object  
            }  
            function n(){  
            alert(window.value);//accessing global variable from other function  
            }  
            m();
            n();
            </script> 
    </xmp>
</div>

   </p>

<section id="data">
    <h1>Javascript Data Types
    </h1>
    <pre>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

        1.Primitive data type
        2.Non-primitive (reference) data type

        JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because 
        it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type.
         It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:</pre>
<div id="databox1">
    <xmp>
        var a=40; //holding number  
        var b="Rahul";//holding string 

    </xmp>
</div>
<h1>JavaScript primitive data types
</h1>
<p>
    There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:
    

</section>
<section id="if">
    <h1>JavaScript If-else
    </h1>
    <p>
        The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. 
        There are three forms of if statement in JavaScript.

            1.if Statement
            2.If else statement
            3.if else if statement
            <h2>
                JavaScript If statement

            </h2>
   It evaluates the content only if expression is true. The signature of JavaScript if statement is given below.

  <div id ="boxif">
    <xmp>
        if(expression){  
            //content to be evaluated  
            }
    </xmp>
  </div>
     Let’s see the simple example of if statement in javascript.

<div id="boxif2">
    <xmp>
        <script>  
            var a=20;  
            if(a>10){  
            document.write("value of a is greater than 10");  
            }  
            </script>
    </xmp>
</div >
<h1>JavaScript If...else Statement
</h1>
It evaluates the content whether condition is true of false. The syntax of JavaScript if-else statement is given below.



<div id="boxif3">
    <xmp>
        if(expression){  
            //content to be evaluated if condition is true  
            }  
            else{  
            //content to be evaluated if condition is false  
            }  
    </xmp>
</div>
    </p>
</section>
<section id="loop">
<h1>
    JavaScript Loops
</h1>
<p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while,
     do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.

     There are four types of loops in JavaScript.

     1.for loop
     2.while loop
     3.do-while loop
     4.for-in loop

     <h1>1) JavaScript For loop
    </h1>

    The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times.
     It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below.
